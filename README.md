## Projects

### Brazilian 2022 Elections

Used Python, Pandas and Scikit-learn to produce a regression model that predicts the ratings of the presidential candidates in the second round of the 2022 Brazilian Elections. Achieved a model with a score of 0.85 and an average absolute error of 5%. The input data is manually scraped from the [IBGE page](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/downloads-estatisticas.html), and is comprised by 

### Multilayer backpropagating neural network in Mathematica

Wrote a brute force Neural Network algorithm in Mathematica

### Higgs statistics
[Project's page](https://github.com/betobarela/Higgs-discovery-di-gamma)

Utilized the Higgs search (which culminated in one of the greatest achievements in the history of science) to illustrate a lesson in statistics. The project's execution consisted of several steps, whose major ones were the simulation, statistics and the visualization of results. The main goal of the project was to obtain the exclusion contour over the Higgs mass and the signal strength using the modified frequentist confidence level, which appears below

A more detailed description of the process appears in the page of the project.
