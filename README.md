## Projects

### Brazilian 2022 Elections

Used Python, Pandas and Scikit-learn to produce a regression model that predicts the ratings of the presidential candidates in the second round of the 2022 Brazilian Elections. Achieved a model with a score of 0.85 and an average absolute error of 5%. The input data is manually scraped from the [IBGE page](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/downloads-estatisticas.html), and is comprised by 

### Multilayer backpropagating neural network in Mathematica
